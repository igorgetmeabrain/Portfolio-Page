# Portfolio-Page (freeCodeCamp challenge)

This project was created to fulfil an element of the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp.  
The main aim of the project is to create a portfolio page to showcase small projects, using a simple, adaptable layout, to which new content can be added as required.

## Project Criteria

The required user stories are:  
1. My portfolio should have a welcome section with an id of welcome-section.
2. The welcome section should have an h1 element that contains text.
3. My portfolio should have a projects section with an id of projects.
4. The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project.
5. The projects section should contain at least one link to a project.
6. My portfolio should have a navbar with an id of navbar.
7. The navbar should contain at least one link that I can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.
8. My portfolio should have a link with an id of profile-link, which opens my GitHub or FCC profile in a new tab.
9. My portfolio should have at least one media query.
10. The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport.
11. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

The project is submitted via Codepen, using a CDN link to run tests to verify completion of the user stories:

## Design

I went for simplicity for this final project. Less is more. A fixed background image (resized with media queries), overlaid with three semi-transparent background colours to demarcate the sections of the page. A fixed navbar at the top for easy navigation and links to my external coding accounts at the bottom of the page. The Projects section is a simple flexbox layout with a 3D effect on the tiles on hover. I intend to continue to add to this as progress through further certifications.

## Conclusion

This challenge is the culmination of several months work, learning to code from scratch, and whilst my confidence and abilities are continuing to develop, I can already see where I could improve on all of the projects which I have submitted thus far. However, in the interests of obsessive-tweak-avoidance, they will remain as they are, and I will look forward to my next project instead!
